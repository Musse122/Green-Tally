                <h2>How We Started</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The concept for Green Tally came to me after attending a climate workshop last year. Many individuals there were eager to assist the environment but were uncertain about how to begin. A few of us sought an easy method to monitor our impact without requiring a science degree to grasp it. Thatâ€™s why I created this tool for my final year project. I sought something that not only displays numbers but also aids individuals in making improved decisions in their daily lives. </p>

                <h2>The Research</h2>
            </div>
            <p>I did a lot of reading about carbon footprints for this project. The concept first became popular in the early 2000s, but now we have much better data about how our choices affect the environment.</p>
            <p>For the emissions factors, I used data from several sources including:</p>
            <ul class="basic-list">
                <li>EPA transport emissions guidelines</li>
                <li>UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)</li>
                <li>Research papers on dietary carbon impacts</li>
                <li>Local electricity grid carbon intensity data</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
       
        
        <div class="content-block">
            <div class="simple-header">
           
                <h2>Future Generations</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Climate change isn't just a theory - it's something that will affect our future in real ways. I made this calculator thinking about what world we want to leave for the next generations.</p>
            <p>Every little change adds up. If thousands of people make small improvements, it has a huge collective impact.</p>
