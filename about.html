                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Green Tally was established in early 2025 by a Universty Student  aiming to build a useful tool for the general public. We think that assessing your impact is the initial move to minimizing it. Our goal is straightforward: to ensure carbon footprint measurement is easy to access, comprehend, and act upon for all individuals. We aim not only to share figures but also to assist you in implementing genuine transformations.</p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Green Tally employs research-supported metrics to assess your carbon footprint according to your lifestyle decisions. Our formulas are derived from scientific studies that have been peer-reviewed and are consistently revised. We examine key elements such as travel routines, energy consumption, and food preferences to create an overview of your ecological footprint. Although no calculator can achieve complete accuracy, Green Tally offers a practical estimate that aids in identifying your most significant impact areas.  </p>
